* Inspiration : I am a executive member of Robotics Club and IEEE student Branch where our team orgainzes many events, workhshop, seminar/webinar etc and recently our club organized a event named when first time i used the Hard Coded version of this python script using pillow and zip library to automate the certificate for filling serial numbers.
