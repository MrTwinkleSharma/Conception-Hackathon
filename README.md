* Inspiration : I am a executive member of Robotics Club and IEEE student Branch where our team orgainzes many events, workhshop, seminar/webinar etc and recently our club organized a event, when first time i used the Hard Coded version of this python script with pillow and zip library to automate the certificates for filling serial numbers. That's why i thought to extend this idea with generalize so that it can be used for a wide purpose.
